# Sun-Burnt
Sun Burnt Project

I began developing a weather dashboard API using JavaScript, jQuery, and the Fetch API to retrieve data from the OpenWeather site.

Upon reviewing my code, I found it overly complex and challenging to comprehend. Consequently, I decided to simplify the codebase without incorporating CSS.

I am pleased with the project's outcome and would like to acknowledge the guidance I received from my tutor, "JJ."

Here are the steps I followed to create the API dashboard:

1) Created a basic HTML file.

2) Registered an account with openweather.org to obtain the API key.

3) Initialized a variable in the script file to store the API key.

4) Implemented a function to search the local storage for previous searches and, if found, displayed them in button format.

5) Developed a fetch function to request the current weather and a five-day forecast.

6) Utilized a for loop to extract the desired data values and render them in the Document Object Model (DOM).

Below are examples illustrating how the program operates:
